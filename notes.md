### Notes for Fall 2014

### Fundamental properties of matter
  - energy
  - charge
  - time

#### Energy (W)
Energy is the ability to do work
  - Kinetic energy: moving
  - Potential energy: does not move
The symbol to represent the quantity of energyis (W). Energy is measured in 
Joules

#### Charge (Q)
This is the flow of electrons through a cross-section of a material, materials 
that do this well are called conductors They are mostly metals

charge is measured in Coulumbs. The mathematical expression (Q) is used to 
represent charge

#### Time (t)
Time is measured in seconds

### Current (I)
it has both direction and magnitude. Current flows through a component
the unit of current is amperes
I = Q/T
The way we will talk about current is that it moves from the (+) side to the 
(-) side

### Battery
it is a chemical system that seperates charge

# formular
I * t = Q

## Voltage (V)
it is measured in volts, energy per unit charge
1 Volt = 1 Joule per Coulumb
V = W/Q

The two things that we can really measure are voltage and current

we use a switch to control the flow of electrons

### Ohms law
Voltage = current * resistance

### Kirchoffs Voltage law
sum of all voltages around a closed loop = 0
