\begin{enumerate}

  \item 100 microCoulombs of charge flows through a device in 25 milliseconds.  How much current is
    flowing through the device? \\
    \[ I = \frac{Q}{T} \]
    \[ I = \frac{100 \: microCoulombs}{25 \: milliseconds} \]
    \[ I = \frac{0.0001}{0.025} \]
    \[ I = 2.5 * 10 ^ {-06}\]
  \item If 50 milliAmperes of current is continuously flowing through a device, how much charge passes
    through the device in 200 microseconds?
    \[ 50 \: milliAmpere = \frac{Q}{200 \: microseconds} \]
    \[ 0.05 * 0.0002 = Q \]
    \[ 1 * 10 ^ {-05}  = Q\] 
  \item How much energy does 50 milliCoulombs of charge have when it flows out of a 1.5 Volt battery?
    \[ V = \frac{W}{Q} \]
    \[ 1.5 = \frac{W}{50 \: milliCoulombs } \]
    \[ 1.5 * .05 \: coulombs = W \]
    \[ .075 = W \]
  \item If a device uses 20 milliJoules of energy in 100 milliseconds, how much power does the device
    dissipate?
  \item f a particular battery has a capacity of 250 milliAmpere‐hours, how much charge is stored by
    the battery?
